Working on the coding challenge was, overall, a beneficial experience.
With so many different means of accomplishing the task, it really lends itself to practice in many different areas.

First and foremost was the design and interpretation of the project. 
I initially sketched out what it would look like in plain Java, not as a web appplication/RESTful API, without any use of Web Frameworks.
The simple design is just to have 3-4 Classes:
  -A Main class to initiate the program.
  -An Application class to simulate the web requests
      -This class would have a menu to prompt the user for what they wish to do, and 2 arrayLists or HashMaps to 
      hold all Organizations and Users.
      -This class would simply loop, asking the user for what the wish to do every time, exiting when stated so by the user.
      It also has the accessory functions that will go through and search for Usersor Organizations, to remove a member from 
      their map field.
  -A User Class
  -An Organization Class
  
  Aside from the fields requested, both User and Organization would have a hashmap of the opposing class, so as to form the
  proper connection of a user being a member and vice versa.
